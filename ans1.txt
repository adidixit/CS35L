1. man -k keyword will search for the keyword in the man page. 

2. the command- which cp prints the location of cp (repeat for wc). 
/usr/local/cs/bin/cp 
/usr/local/cs/bin/wc 

3. By typing /usr/local/cs/bin -name "?", we can find all such functions. And by looking up the man page, we can find out what these functions do. 
[ - conditional expression
X - portable, network transparent window system  
w - shows the users that are logged in and their activities.

4. cd /usr/local/cs/bin to enter the repository. 
ls -l "emacs" will show us that the symbolic link actually executes the file /etc/alternatives/emacs.

5. g+s - gives the user permission of a group for the file 
o-x removes the executable permisssion for others for the file in question.

6. find -mtime -21 shows all the files. Found the answer in the man find page.

7. find -type d -mtime -21 will show all directories modified in the last 3 weeks.

8. Looking for hints in man find: 
find -type l in the /usr/bin directory shows that there are 287 symbolic links. 

9. Enter lib directory using cd /usr/lib 
ls -lt will sort out the files with the newest at the top. 
The last file on the bottom that doesn't start with a d is the oldest regular file. 

10. man locale tells us that its data is determined by the settings of the environment variables 
find /usr -name locale

11. We can find the commands in emacs by typin: 
C-h a sort and here are some results we get: 
sort-lines
sort-pages
sort-fields
sort-columns
rmail-sort-by-author
rmail-sort-by-date
rmail-sort-by-labels
rmail-sort-by-lines
rmail-sort-by-recipient
rmail-sort-by-subject

12. 
C -M-a = move to the start of the function
C -M-b = move backward over next balanced expression
C -M-c = exit recursive edit (exit from innermost)
C -M-d = move down one level of paranthesis 
C -M-e = move to next end of defun 
C -M-f = move forward one balanced expression 

13. C-h k C-g tells us what C-g does which is cancel the current command. 

14. The yank function (or C-y) is used to re-insert previously removed text. 

15. The emacs dired function shows total available memory but ls -l only shows the space used.
